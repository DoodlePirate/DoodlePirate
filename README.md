# About Me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: the Full Stack Developer Certification through freeCodeCamp and an Online Degree through Finger Lakes Community College in Smart Systems Technology.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Tech stuff - auditing CSS, Electronic Theory, and Survey of Function I. Non-tech stuff - practicing my spinning long draw for a sock yarn project and attempting to recreate a medieval spindle and distaff.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Anything that helps me gain skills.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: yarn, spinning wheels, fiber arts, gardening, my 3 cats, my college sophomore at UB, or what it's like revisiting skills and learning new ones after 20 years.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her

- âš¡ Fun fact: Decided that turning 40 is the new 20 and I'm learning a whole bunch of new shit. *Because **I CAN**!*
